### About the Project

During the Workshop, the tutor goes through the process of creating a Weather App, step by step, but the design they focused on was very different from the design that I created. **Moving away from the course's design made me come accorss challenges that I had to figure out by myself**.

### Built With

- React
- HTML
- CSS
- API intergration
- Bootstrap

### Continued development
- Add dark mode theme, and have it change automatically when the sun sets and rises in the current location.
- Celcius to Fahrenheit conversion for the 5 day forecast, not just the current temperature.
